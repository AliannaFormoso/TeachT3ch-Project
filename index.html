                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for
                the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
                network). Web development can range from developing a simple
                single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet
                applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social
                network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which
                web development commonly refers, may include web engineering,
                web design, web content development, client liaison,
                client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network
                security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web
                professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main
                non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and
                coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS)
                to make content changes easier and available with basic
                technical skills.

          <h2>Frontend Web Development</h2>

          <p>
            Frontend Web development: is the practice of converting data to a
            graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            so that users can view and interact with that data.<br />
            There are several tools and platforms (wordpress, magento etc..)
            available that can be used to develop the front end of a website,
            and understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks marks
            the difference between developing a hacked site and a well designed,
            scalable site.

                The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup
                language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
                browser. It is the most basic building block of the Web. It
                defines the meaning and structure of web content.

                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
                World Wide Web.

                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
                that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
                high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
                has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                object-orientation, and first-class functions.
